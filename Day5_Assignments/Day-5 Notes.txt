1. Why do we use Functions in programming languages?
*****************************************************

Ans. * A function is a group of statements/ block of code that performs a specific task.
     * Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusability.

Some of the key benefits of using functions are:
-------------------------------------------------
--> to improves the readability of code.
--> Enables reusability and reduces redundancy.
--> Makes a code modular.
--> Provides abstraction functionality.
--> The program becomes easy to understand and manage.
--> Breaks an extensive program into smaller and simpler pieces.

2.Diff between parameters and arguments?
****************************************************

Ans. * Parameters: Variables defined in the function declaration. Eg: function sum(param1, param2)
       Arguments: Actual values or variables passed to the function. Eg: sum(3,5)

     * A parameter is a variable defined by a method that receives a value when a method is called. It serves as a placeholder for data that will be provided when the function or method is called. 
       Arguments is the value that is passed to a method when it is invoked. These values serve as inputs to the function during its execution.

    * Parameters are used to receive the arguments passed to a function when it is called.
      They are used to supply the values to the parameters of a function. 
 Note: The number of arguments must match the number of parameters in the function definition.
     
3. What is Function Overloading?
**********************************************

Ans. * Function Overloading defines that two or more methods in a class with the same name but different numbers, types, and order of parameters - it is called method overloading.

4. How do implement function Overloading in C#?
************************************************
Ans. *Method overloading can be achieved by the following:
       --> By changing the number of parameters in a method.
       --> By changing the order of parameters in a method.
       --> By using different data types for parameters.

5.When do we use ref and out keywords in functions in C#?
**********************************************************
Ans. * We use the ref keyword when a called parameter needs to update the parameter (passed). 
       We use the out keyword when a called method needs to update multiple parameters (passed).

     * Ref keyword used to pass a variable as a reference to a method.
       Out keyword used to return multiple values from a method.

     * Ref parameter should assign the value before calling.
       out parameter is not required to assign the value by calling the function.

6. Can we return multiple values from a function?
**************************************************
Ans. No, you can't return multiple values from a function in C#. In C#, a method can only return a single value.
     
   * Using a custom class:-
        You can create a custom class to store the multiple values and return an object of that class from the method.
   * Using out parameters:-
        C# allows you to use out parameters to return multiple values from a method.
