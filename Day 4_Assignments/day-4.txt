1. Why do we use loops in Programming Languages?

Ans. * Loop is a set of instructions that is executed repetitively based on a condition.
     * A Loop is used to execute a group of instructions or a block of code multiple times, without writing it repeatedly. 
     * The block of code is executed based on a certain condition. Loops are the control structures of a program.

  Advantages:
---------------
  ---> Write one set of instructions to operate on multiple, separate sets of data.
  ---> Allows processing on large sets of data, such as complex payroll and benefits processing.
  ---> Importance of loop in any programming language is immense, they allows us to reduce the number of lines in a code,                 making our code more readable and efficient. 


2.Differnece Between while and Do-while loops?

Ans. *-- In a while loop, the condition is checked before the loop body executes. So the body may not execute even once if the condition is   false from the beginning. 
      -- In a do while loop the body is guaranteed to execute at least once because the condition is checked after executing the body.

     * --A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
      --do while loop is similar to while loop with the only difference that it checks for the condition after executing the statements.


3. How to Represents the loops in the Algorithm ?

Ans.  1. We start by initializing the loop variable with a certain value.
      2. Then, we check if the loop condition is true or not.
      3. If the loop condition is true, the code in the loop body is executed.
      4. Finally, we update the loop variable and move on to the next iteration.

4. How to format the strings in C#? or string.format() method?

Ans. Use String.Format()Method  if you need to insert the value of an object, variable, or expression into another string.
     * For example, you can insert the value of a Decimal value into a string to display it to the user as a single string:

 example:
----------- 
Decimal pricePerOunce = 17.36m;
String s = String.Format("The current price is {0} per ounce.",pricePerOunce);
Console.WriteLine(s);
// Result: The current price is 17.36 per ounce.

5. Switch Case:
    
switch(Expression)
{
   case value: statements; break;
   case value: statements; break;
   case value: statements; break;
   case value: statements; break;
   ---
   default: statemets; break;
}
