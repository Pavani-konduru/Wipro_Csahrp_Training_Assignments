1. What is the Significance of static members in C#?
*****************************************************
Ans.--> The static member is callable on a class even when no instance of the class exists. 
    --> The static member is always accessed by the class name, not the instance name.
    --> Static methods can be overloaded but not overridden, because they belong to the class, and not to any instance of the 
    --> static members is used for recording data common to all objects of a class. 
        class.

2. Difference Between Static and Instance Members?
***************************************************
Ans. ==> Static members are considered to be part of the class. 
         Instance members are associated with instances of a type.
     ==> a static variable is initialized one and only one time.
         Instance variables are initialized for 0 times if no instance is created and n times if n instances are created.
     ==> static classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and contain only static members.
         Non-static classes, also known as instance classes, can be instantiated and contain both static and instance members.
         They are useful for representing objects that have a specific state and behavior.  

3. How to use static keyword and how to access static members?   
*************************************************************** 
Ans. --> It can be used with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. 
     --> It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
     --> To access a static member through the name of the class in which it is declared. 
     --> Static is a modifier in C# which is applicable for the following: 
            Classes
            Variables
            Methods
            Constructor
     --> It is also applicable to properties, event, and operators.
     --> To create a static member(class, variable, methods, constructor), precede its declaration with the keyword static. 
     --> When a member is declared static, it can be accessed with the name of its class directly.

4. How to Override the ToString() method in your class?
********************************************************
Ans. To override the ToString method in your class or struct:

    ==> Declare a ToString method with the following modifiers and return type: public override string ToString(){}
    ==> Implement the method so that it returns a string.
